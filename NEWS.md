==========

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a few problems with using duplicated inputs to `subset` ([issue #88](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/85), [issue #89](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/85))
* Fixed a bug that caused an error when using unnamed vectors ([issue #86](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/86))
* Fixed a bug that prevents using sequence accession numbers ([issue #85](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/85))
* Fixed bug in `lookup_tax_data` and `extract_tax_data` that caused an error when one of the queries failed too download.

### Improvements

* Make default dataset for `n_obs` and `n_obs_1` and make them available for NSE ([issue #91](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/91)
* `parse_tax_data`/`extract_tax_data` can now parse things like `phylum;Nitrosopumilales;order;Nitrosopumilaceae;family;` and split out the rank and taxon names by using multiple matches to the `class_regex` when `class_sep` is NULL. 
* `extract_tax_data` now gives warnings if a regex does not match.
