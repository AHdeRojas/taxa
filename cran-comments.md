## Reverse dependencies

### metacoder

I also maintain `metacoder`. The current CRAN version will have test errors with this version of `taxa`, but I will be submitting an update to `metacoder` that is compatible with this version of `taxa` and builds without errors shortly after submitting this version of `taxa`.

### taxlist

`taxa` is in the suggests and no code from `taxa` is actually used.
