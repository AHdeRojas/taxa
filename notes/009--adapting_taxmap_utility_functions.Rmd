# Issue 009) Adapt `taxmap` utility functions to `taxonomy`

## Thu Sep 22 14:18:34 2016

I noticed that the edge list in `taxonomy` does not have an edge for each taxon. 
This is different than how it was structured in `metacoder` and this is making adapting functions like `supertaxa` more difficult than I thought. 
Also, the algolrythm used to construct the edge list involves an all-vs-all comparison of `taxon` objects. 
I think I had originally done something like this in `metacoder`, but eventully opted for a recursive strategy to make it faster on large datasets.
However, I dont think I have ever taken into account situations like:

a > b > c
b > c

Something to look into...

I think I have a non-recursive way to make an edge list from hierarchies. 

```
mammalia <- taxon(
  name = taxon_name("Mammalia"),
  rank = taxon_rank("class"),
  id = taxon_id(9681)
)
plantae <- taxon(
  name = taxon_name("Plantae"),
  rank = taxon_rank("kingdom"),
  id = taxon_id(33090)
)
unidentified <- taxon(
  name = taxon_name("unidentified"),
  rank = taxon_rank("species"),
  id = taxon_id(0)
)
x <- taxonomy(unidentified_plant, unidentified_animal)
> x
<Taxonomy>
  3 taxa: 1. Plantae, 2. unidentified, 3. Mammalia
  2 edges: 1->2, 3->2
```
